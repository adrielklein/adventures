I started my trip from Albany, NY, the intersection of the Hudson River and Interstate Highway 90. I decided to take a bus over Massachusetts to avoid the mountains in early spring. This being my first self-supported tour, I wanted to make my life a little easier and take the nice flat bike path along the Erie Canal.

I was lucky to get good weather on my first day of the trip. I considered doing a wheel dip in the Hudson, but couldn't really find a good spot for it. I ended up settling for a photo and got on my way.

I had felt pretty free riding on that first day. I had just quit my job, said goodbye, and left. Three great steps towards embarking on a long distance tour! My future was uncertain, but there was some tranquility in riding down a peaceful bike path on a one-way journey.
