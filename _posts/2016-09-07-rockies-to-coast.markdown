# Colorado

From Pueblo we had a long way to go in both distance and elevation. Although the road looked flat, it was going up pretty steadily for a while.

The next day from Cañon City to Fairplay was one of my favorites.

![Facebook](https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14556542_10207506478000313_1106565885061190935_o.jpg)

On our way up we passed through an area called South Park, a relatively flat area surrounded by mountains.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/015v1Ct.jpg)

The ride was pretty much all uphill with very little traffic. I didn’t realize just how remote this area would be. In fact, we had to flag down some cars to get more water along the way.

Our destination for the day was Fairplay, a town which is the basis for the TV show “South Park”. I found a cool looking gate with the name “Ike” written on it. It turns out that's the name of one of the characters on the show so I wonder if it's a coincidence or not.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/3AiN8v8.jpg)

Along the way up, we crossed paths with The Great Divide Mountain Biking Route, a mountain biking trail along the continental divide spanning from Canada to Mexico. We met a guy who doing the whole thing. His bike looked really rugged, an important quality when riding through the spine of the continent.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/WCEUVoc.jpg)

By the time we got to Fairplay, we were really tired and ate a big dinner at Subway. I asked for an 18" sub which unfortunately didn't exist. However, I combined a foot long with a six inch so I basically had my way with it anyways.

That night we had planned on staying with a Warm Showers host. It’s amazing how kind and trusting people are because this man wasn’t even home but told us we could feel free to use his house and camp in his yard. Better yet, our absent host had a bunch of kittens that greeted us as we arrived.

![Kittens](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15042226_10207819200498180_5669654631266997660_o.jpg)

Although it was summer, it still got a bit chilly camping at 10,000+ feet, however we managed to make it through the night and the next day made it over Hoosier pass to Breckenridge where we stayed with some friendly couchsurfing hosts that were around our age.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/fuCxWwb.jpg)

The next morning we were heading to Idaho Springs and had a big climb ahead of us.

![route](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15110528_10207827373822508_497850645514919510_o.jpg)

On our way out of Breckenridge, Google maps led us on a bike path that was truly stunning.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/9UVL8vJ.jpg)

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/2RWwrRv.jpg)

After passing through Keystone, we were up for our biggest challenge yet of our trip: **Loveland pass**. Although the climb was difficult, we were rewarded the whole way up with beautiful views. It was great when we finally reached the top!

![Imgur](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/p960x960/15042109_10207827434184017_965193472533369500_o.jpg)

The next 30 miles involved very little pedalling. Also the whole route parallels I-70 so there was very little traffic which made it even better.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/cNiltpo.jpg)

We settled into a cute couchsurfing house in Idaho Springs and cooked ourselves a nice meal. Our host wasn’t even home but had trusted us with her house anyways. Yet again, we had found another amazingly generous and trusting host!

Our host ended up returning to her house the next day and we had a great time chatting with her. She told us stories about the other guests she had as well as her journey hiking the Colorado Trail. Thanks to her I have another thing to put on my bucket list.

The next couple days we took off to rest a little bit. I had met up with a cousin living in Denver who took me to this great glacier with some nice cliff jumping.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epa2qD5-8cA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The next day we decided to take on Mt. Evans. I had heard about Mt. Evans a couple years ago from a friend and ever since had been hoping to climb it. In fact, Idaho Springs wasn’t even on the original route, but we made an extra effort to come out here for the mountain.

The ride itself was a total 56 miles with 6,800ft of elevation gain. Twenty eight miles would be up and the other twenty eight back down. We started riding around sunrise so we’d be able to get the road to ourselves before traffic hit. Starting early was a good idea because we had pretty much the entire road to ourselves for most of the climb.

One of my favorite parts of the ride was seeing the mountain goats. I’m always amazed by new animals I find out in the wild.

![Goats](https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14481883_10207506467240044_7776201001955381005_o.jpg)

Although it was cold at the top of the mountain, the view was rewarding.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/budY8ly.jpg)

After Mount Evans we started heading North towards Wyoming and made our way over Berthoud Pass, another big climb.

![Facbook](https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14500757_10207506691685655_2763764062094189559_o.jpg)

Our destination for the day was Tabernash. We had only planned on staying one day there, but the area was so nice that we decided to spend two. Our Warm Showers host was really nice guy who had done a bit of touring himself. He told us about all the delicious meals he prepares while he tours and almost inspired me to buy a camping stove.

Our host was also an avid Tour de France fan so I watched some of the races with him.

In the morning we got to catch a fresh glimpse of the beautiful area we had the pleasure of staying at.

![Tabernash](https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14542432_10207506687525551_8919220153362848220_o.jpg)

The next day we headed towards Walden Colorado. Yet again we had a mountain pass and crossed the continental divide, however this mountain pass wasn’t as high. The climb up Willow Creek Pass was very pleasant and there wasn’t too much traffic.

![Facebook](https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14559974_10207506687605553_5726420898160739675_o.jpg)

When we got to town, we met a supported cross country bike touring group called the Fuller Center. They invited us to the church they were staying at shared some stories about our trips. They were a great group of people.

# Wyoming

The next day we made our way into Wyoming and had some stunning scenery to ride through. One of the main differences from Wyoming and Colorado seems to be that Wyoming feels a lot more deserted.

![Wyoming](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15110871_10207819286740336_5706661731210290779_o.jpg)

![Wyoming](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15068956_10207819290740436_6597670242408497090_o.jpg)

Also, Wyoming doesn’t have as many trees so most of the time you can see for miles and miles in any direction.

![Wyoming](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15069161_10207819292780487_8919914430768605205_o.jpg)

I noticed that the mountains in Wyoming aren’t as grand and tall as they are in Colorado, but rather they are more dispersed. I can't say I prefer one over the other, but there was something special about the landscape of Wyoming. It's like the mountains are more lonely.

![Wyoming](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15000744_10207819295820563_8291222200724655108_o.jpg)

![Wyoming](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15025529_10207819297020593_1022000855785025195_o.jpg)

![Wyoming](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15016449_10207819299060644_7994383830063000582_o.jpg)

What’s was cool about riding through Wyoming is to realize just how high we were during the whole route. Most of the time we were riding at about 7,000ft but sometimes it’s easy to forget that since we were used to it. Both the high elevation a small population means that there's a bunch of tiny towns up in the mountains. I soon learned that these small towns are important to Wyoming's identity. As a matter of fact, a local man I met told me “In Wyoming, you can’t trust a city whose population is higher than its elevation.”

The next town we stayed at was Jeffrey City. At 6,335ft and with a population of just 58, this town would be very trustworthy according to the saying.

As a former uranium mining town, Jeffrey City’s population rose to almost 5,000 in the late 1970s. The uranium produced from this town was a valueable resource in the production of nuclear power. However, after a [nuclear power accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident) in 1979, nuclear power brought about major safety concerns and strict goverment regulations were imposed on its production. Consequently, the industry fell downhill rapidly, taking down the price of uranium and Jeffrey City along with it.

Despite being an absolute ghost town, Jeffrey City was the perfect place for a bike tourist. First of all, it feels like you are travelling through the past when walking around the streets. Also, there did happen to be a couple of shops that were still up an running. One of them happened to be a nice little pottery shop run by a friendly man.

![](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14195351_10207819301340701_7016229623481050133_o.jpg)

I found a bunch of cool pottery pieces as well as other random stuff in his shop like a fox hide. After googling the name of his shop after my tour, I found a cool video that the potter had posted on youtube called "Pot Shots". The video is really well done and I'm impressed with his work!

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_i8DyMLw9No" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As for accomodation, there was a church that graciously opened up its doors for touring cyclists.

![](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15025169_10207819300460679_7417555170794927327_o.jpg)

As we continued along the nothingness of Wyoming, we were continually rewarded with great scenery.

![Wyoming scenery with two bikes](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15068941_10207819307300850_6094352478997760079_o.jpg)

During one of these rides, I saw my first bald eagle out in the wild.

![Eagle far](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15000125_10207819305780812_7804262559713872457_o.jpg)

![Eagle close](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15068963_10207819304780787_2049967579706108510_o.jpg)

Unfortunately I didn't have a camera scope or binoculars with me, but even seeing the great American icon from a distance was a special experience.

Our next stop was one of my favorite locations of the trip. We ended up finding the most friendly, welcoming couchsurfing hosts in Lander, WY that we planned on staying with for two nights. Being so close to some beautiful riding and hiking, our rest day did not involve much resting at all. Instead we spent the day exploring the area outside of the city.

![Lander WY climb](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15110453_10207819310580932_8413188703340654091_o.jpg)

As if we hadn't already been spoiled enough with the natural beauty of WY, our route was about to lead us through two US National Parks: Grand Teton and Yellowstone.

Grand Teton NP came first and we found a great campground just next to Jackson Lake.

![Jackson lake](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15025225_10207819819833663_1976891377703458165_o.jpg)

Some of the riding around this area exposed me to some great views of the Tetons as well as some of the wildlife.

![Tetons](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15025619_10207819823233748_3457954152002252775_o.jpg)

![Moose](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14991113_10207819314301025_4987253773706500233_o.jpg)


As we headed through Yellowstone, we passed by the famous Old Faithful Geiser and ended up staying in the heart of the park with [Clay](http://www.clayshow.org/), a park ranger we found on Warm Showers. This guy is impressive! In addition to being a park ranger, he is a travelling circus on bicycle and a skilled photographer. I managed to find a great photo of his bike on his website.

![Bike set up](http://www.clayshow.org/koken/storage/cache/images/000/445/untitled-HDR,medium_large.2x.1478358760.jpg)

Being a park ranger, Clay was a great person talk to about the park. He offered us tidbits of information of the geological phenomenons that happens at this part of the Earth.

As we were setting up our tents in his yard, we spotted some elk walking around nearby.

![Elk](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15039729_10207819317661109_6575400394511207617_o.jpg)

Although both are a type of deer, the elk is quite different than the typical deer I am familiar with back east, the whitetail. The greatest different is size. While a whitetail buck can weigh up to 300lbs, a male elk (called a bull) typically weighs more than double that.

One host I stayed at was very passionate about elk hunting. He told me about elk bugling, a sound involving squeeling and grunting that the bull makes to intimidate foes or gather its cows (females). As he explained to me, any true elk hunter is intimately familiar with the spectacular vocalization.

In addition to the man's excitement about elk, I could tell the animal was a special part of Wyoming by some of the amazing displays of antlers.

![Antlers](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/p720x720/15025098_10207840932121457_1925618590242597639_o.jpg)

As impressive as the arch was, I couldn't help but think to myself, "Man, they must have had to kill a bunch of elk to make that work of art. How cruel!"

It was only until later when I learned that the bull sheds and regrows his antlers each year. So rather than killing the elk, these artistic piecies of bone are typically [collected by boy scouts](http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/11685) at the national elk refuge after the winter shed.

Apparently the species is plentiful on both public and private lands so endangerment is not a concern. As a matter of fact, there are estimated to be about a million elk living in the US and strict hunting regulations ensure their abundance. Although I lack both the expertise and equipment to hunt the great beast, I hope to some day photograph a bull in the wild.

Some others species on my list to find are wild horses, pronghorns, and mountain lions. I've been told that mountain lions will be especially hard to find since they are stealthy hunters by nature. As one man told me, "You've probably never seen a mountain lion in the wild, but there's a good chance they've seen you."

# Montana

![Montana state sign](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-0/p600x600/15069010_10207832645874306_3120064244606464471_o.jpg)

After leaving Yellowstone, our next interesting geological place was Quake Lake.

![Quake lake](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/q82/p960x960/15110367_10207827561947211_8977523391749054029_o.jpg)

As you might notice, there are dead trees rising up from the lake. You might be asking yourself: Why were the trees growing from the bottom of a lake to begin with?

As it turns out, these trees didn't initially start growing from the lake, but grew as regualr trees on dry land next to a river. However, that soon changed on a quiet summer night in 1959 when [an unexpected earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Hebgen_Lake_earthquake) shook the earth so hard that 80 million tons of land came crashing down from the nearby mountains into the river.

The mud, rocks, and debris from the landslide dammed the river, resulting in the birth of a new lake called Quake (or Earthquake) Lake. Something tells me the geological anomoly reveals only a hint of just how powerful this geothermal region really is.

It's hard to tell exactly the difference from Montana and Wyoming, but Montana seems to be a bit more green.

![Montana](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15025224_10207833632018959_5225051159249377292_o.jpg)

![Montana](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15042197_10207833635339042_3630327503833182793_o.jpg)

In general we either stayed in campgrounds or public parks in Montana, however in Ennis, MT there was a distillery that allowed cyclists to camp in their back yard for free. We decided to take up the free offer and met about five other cyclists that were staying at the distillery also.

We met a young couple that were heading the opposite direction as us and I had a great idea of a gift to give to them. Since Erika and I were leaving bear country and they were just about to enter it, I would give them my canister of bear spray that I had bought in Wyoming. Not only would I be helping out some fellow travellers, but I be able to shed off an item that was no longer useful for me.

Before I handed the couple the bear spray, I figured I would do them an extra favor and teach them how to use it.

I took off the safety, pointed the canister towards the ground, and pressed down the trigger. Shortly after releasing the spray, I realized I hadn't quite pointed it close enough to the ground. As the orange mist spread through the air, the four of us began to cough profusely and some of us even began tearing up.

Fortunately after about ten minutes of discomfort, we were all fine and I apologized to everybody. I learned my lesson though about giving bear spray demonstrations!

Our journey continued to Missoula where we were planning on taking a day off. Shortly after arriving to Missoula, we got word that Erika's grandmother's friend's cousin and her husband owned a home in Missoula and offered to host us. They were the kindest old couple and had some great stories to share about their adventures and hobbies. I thought their collection of animal skulls was really cool.

![Animal skulls](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-0/p526x296/15003274_10207833640219164_8555496168346064163_o.jpg)

# Idaho

As we continued into Idaho, we were continually pleased of the stunning scenery this country has to offer. For hundreds of miles, we following winding roads next to rivers that seems to have carved pathways through the mountains.

![Lochsa River](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15128880_10207834583602748_4712693267381615734_o.jpg)

![Salmon River](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15138572_10207833648219364_1037633154376956312_o.jpg)

On one hot day when we were taking a midday break in White Bird, Idaho, we struck up a conversation with a man who invited us to stay in his home. We were still about 20 miles from his home but it was in our direction. Intrigued by free accomodation and the company of some friendly locals, we rode over to his town, picked up some groceries, and headed over to his house.

His wife and family were very welcoming and were very kind. It turns out their family had moved around a bit and the father was employed with a river rafting company.

# Oregon

Our first night in Oregon we spent camping at a Lions Club park in a small town called Halfway. The next morning, a man approached us in the park. He asked us all about our tour and he told us about some of his adventures as well. He then asked us, "Have you had any breakfast yet?".

"Not yet", I replied, "but we have some bread and peanutbutter that we can eat". The man looked at us with excitement and said, "Give me ten minutes or so and I'll be back out with your breakfast."

Sure enough, about ten minutes later the man came back with two delicious duck egg omletes mixed with fresh vegetables from his garden and a side of fruit. Apparently the man was a former chef, and the quality of his food reflected it. The man's generosity was a great start to our first full day in Oregon.

I can't say that I saw an immediate change in landscape from Idaho to Oregon, but as we progressed a couple hundred miles West, things definitely started changing.

![Oregon](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15123220_10207835083975257_3801626442109586467_o.jpg)

![Painted Hills](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15123239_10207835094535521_5525775440695588930_o.jpg)

The landscape started looking like a Dr. Seuss book, with lots of lumps and great colors.

One of the cool parts about bike touring in Oregon is that it is the only state in the country with [offical Scenic Bikeways](http://traveloregon.com/content/uploads/2014/07/2016-Scenic-Bikeways-Map.pdf). As a result of the popular cycling culture, we were delighten to bike-centric hosts like [The Spoke'n Hostel](http://spokenhostel.org/) along the way. This place used to be a church but was converted to a hostel specifically for cyclists.

![Hostel](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14542530_10207506861769907_3390872111722879363_o.jpg)

It was not only nice to have a bed and showers, but it was fun to meet other cyclists and share some stories about our trips. The hostel also had a giant world map where each guest can put a pin of where they are from. Portland was by far the most popular location, but there were pins all around the world, especially the Netherlands. Although there were pins on Boston, I think I was the first to pin down Sharon, MA.

The next day, we made our way to a little town called Terrabonne. Since it was a big day of riding we only got there in the evening. Unfortunately we handn't really planned out where we would stay, but we asked around and some guy brought us to somebody's yard he said we could camp in. The problem was that the yard was full of junk and overgrown shrubbery, we weren't exactly sure that the owner was okay with us staying there, and we had no access to bathrooms or running water.

I knew that there was a state park nearby, but from what I had gathered, the parks campground was too far away for us to reach before sunset. I kind of went into panick mode at this point, because I didn't feel comfortable staying in that yard and I didn't know where else we could stay. I think a man at a local shop noticed my distressed. He came over and told us that the campground at the state park was only a couple miles away, despite my misconception that it was further.

We packed up our bags and headed towards the park, making it there just before sunset.

![sunset](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15025304_10207835222378717_5879737535330524829_o.jpg)

I had never been to a campground like this but I really liked it. Instead of every vehicle having its own camping spot, there was a designated cooking area and a designated sleeping area. The sleeping area was quite large and campers could choose to set up their tents in any spot within the area.

The next morning we realized what a beautiful place we had stumbled upon, and decided to spend the day there hiking.

![smith rock state park](https://scontent.fsnc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15042223_10207835153016983_194346581908128188_o.jpg)

Our route then took us through a volcanic area called Mckenzie pass, and shortly thereafter we crossed paths with the notorious Pacific Crest Trail.

I convinced Erika that we had to walk down the trail for at least a few minutes, allowing us to say we section hiked the trail. It was a short section, but a section nonetheless.

A couple days later, we hit the coast. Although the day was highly overcast we still enjoyed our ride and it was exciting to reach the ocean, a huge milestone in any cross-country bike ride.

The only problem we faced here was that we didn't have a host, and there were no campgrounds in the area. Our philosophy for this trip was to never pay for a hotel or motel, and we had been successful with that for the entire trip so far. However, we had just reached the Pacific Ocean, we were tired, and it was a bit cold and rainy.

So we decided to bite the bullet. I looked up the nearest hotel and got ready give in. Just as we were walking back towards town, a woman passing by looks at me as if she's expecting me. She approaches me and asks, "Excuse me, are you Roger?". I wasn't exactly sure why I would be Roger, but interested in perhaps finding a host, I replied "No I'm not Roger, but why do you ask?".
"Well", she replied, "I run a local Airbnb and I was expecting a man named Roger to come by." Sometimes it's just amazing how things just work out. We ended up talking with her some more and explained that although we weren't the man she was expecting, we were looking for accomodation. For a small fee, she let us use her kitchen, shower, living room, and we camped on her lawn directly accross from the ocean. After reading through her guestbook, we realized another cyclist that we had met in Kansas had stayed at her Airbnb as well.

Although the Oregon coast was crowded the coastal scenery was fantastic. The combination of mountains and beaches make it extra special, something foreign to me as an east coast native.

After a few days on the coast, we made it to the final destination, Astoria, Oregon.

Astoria is signficant because it's where Lewis and Clark hit the Pacific Ocean on their expediation in the early 1800's. Coincidentally, the start of their journey was St. Charles, MO, a city that Erika and I rode through. Does that mean we are as brave and courageous as the original American explorers? Well, one might argue it was more difficult for them to do it having to hunt for their food and traverse over mountains without roads. However, we completed the journey in a significantly shorter time than they did. It took them almost a year and a half to do it and we completed in a couple of months so I'd say we're about equal!
