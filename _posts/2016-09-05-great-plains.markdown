It's been a while since I last posted and I'm glad to finally write again.

Erika and I finished the Katy Trail in Missouri about two weeks ago and now we are in Pueblo, Colorado.

In retrospect, the Katy Trail was a great place to ride. It's a 240 mile long bike path that follows the Missouri river. I would recommend it to anybody interested in bicycle touring, especially to those who haven't had much experience with bicycle touring. The majority of the trail is shaded which makes it ideal for riding during the heat of the day. There are some parts of the trail without overhead cover, but the great views make up for the lack of shade.

The best part of the Katy Trail was how accommodating it is towards cyclists. The state park department does an excellent job maintaining it and there's plenty of amenities along the way. For those seeking a laid back peaceful ride through some nice countryside, I can't think of a better option.

After completing the trail, Erika and I continued our journey out west to join up with the Adventure Cycling Association TransAmerica Trail, one of the most popular routes cyclists take to ride coast to coast.

On our first day leaving the Katy Trail, I decided to take us on a backroads route that ended up being more of an obstacle course than a road. I noticed on the map that the road was closed, but I thought we would be fine riding on it anyways. Despite the obstacles it was absolutely beautiful and I'm glad we took it.

That night we were planning on staying in Appleton City, Missouri, however we hadn't figured out where we were staying. I called up a few churches and left voice messages introducing us and requesting to camp on their lawns. A couple hours later I got a call back from the United Methodist Church. The pastor was super friendly and told us we were more than welcome to stay there.

So we continued riding to Appleton City, happy to know that we could stay with the friendly pastor. The remainder of the ride was on some beautiful country roads with almost zero traffic.

The pastor was one of the friendliest upbeat people I've met. I don't think I'll ever forget this man. His energy level was through the roof. His wife was a sweetheart and his two little kids were cute. They were about to move out of Appleton City so their belongings were scattered throughout the house, but they gave us plenty of space and a separate room to sleep in.

Erika and I ended up helping him move his treadmill out of the basement to give to one of his neighbors. The treadmill was big and heavy so it was not easy to move. We ended up working together to get it into his neighbor's truck. It felt good to help him out because I like to reciprocate the generosity I receive from my hosts whenever possible.

The pastor and his wife were kind enough to feed us. They ordered a pizza and subs for us from a place called Casey's. It was delicious and we had a great time talking with them. Also, that night happened to be Game 7 of the NBA finals so I was really happy that they had a TV and let us watch it. I would have been bummed if we ended up missing the game and I was happy the Cavs won.

The next day we took off to go to Fort Scott, Kansas. We were excited to be passing a state border. I was faced with a dilemma that day about the route we would ride. We could ride on busy paved roads with minimal shoulders or we could ride on gravel roads with almost no traffic. I ended up choosing the second option for us.

As the day progressed we had a tough time dealing with the rocky gravel roads, however, the host for that night made up for any difficulties we had encountered that day. It turns out that the Warm Showers host was an upscale bed and breakfast. We lucked out and got the premier guesthouse that usually goes for $225 a night. For us it was $0. It's truly amazing that we can receive deals like these by riding our bikes.

It turns out that there was a bike race called Race Across America (RAAM) that was going through Fort Scott during our stay there. These people ride continuously day and night across the country. Many of them only get a couple of hours of sleep per night. A lot of them do it for causes but some of them just do it for the fun of it. 

We went to visit the station where the racers could take a break and we met a team of German people. There were about 10 German people on the team. We approached the group of people and started talking to them to learn about their story. There was 1 rider and the rest were the support team. Unfortunately the rider got injured so he was unable to continue, however the support team decided they would finish the ride as a relay race.

We started chatting with one of the friendly Germans. Turns out this guy has biked all over the world. He's biked through multiple continents including extensive riding throughout Australia. I could tell he wasn't kidding because [his Warm Showers account](https://www.warmshowers.org/users/raggamuffin1987) has literally hundreds of feedback posts.

Fort Scott was a great visit especially because of the amazing accommodation, but we were ready to continue onwards. The ride out of Fort Scott was amazing. We found a nicely paved road with rolling hills that paralleled a busier road so there was very little traffic. It got a bit windy, but the wind was mostly in our favor as you can see by the way the leaves are facing on the tree.

After the perfect cycling road ended we were faced with the choice to continue riding on US-54 or take the gravel backroads. Again, I decided to bring us through the backroads and this time it was really rough especially because I think it was nearly 100Â°F.

We finally arrived at Yates Center, KS and used their swimming pool to cool off and shower. Unfortunately their swimming pool was hot so jumping in wasn't as refreshing as we hoped. Afterwards we ended up going to Subway to get lunch.

That night we didn't know where we were going to stay but we were hoping for somebody to volunteer to host us because it would have been miserable camping in that heat. Funny how things work out because just as I was changing a flat tire on the side of a road, a woman walks up to us and offers me help with the tire. I kindly pass up her offer but we strike up a conversation. One thing leads to the next and she invites us to sleep in her air conditioned house and feeds us dinner. Her name was Kate and she even gave us some delicious peanut butter cookies for the next day. What a kind woman.

The next day we reached our first point on the TransAmerica trail.

It was called Lizard's Lips Grill & Deli. They gave us toy lizards. Erika still has hers on her bike but I think I lost mine a few minutes after I received it. I wasn't sad too have lost the toy lizard because I think it would just add clutter to my life. However, I appreciated the kind gift from the people in the store.

I first noticed we were on the TransAmerica trail because there was a guest book for cyclists. I was excited to be on the trail because I knew we would meet more cyclists and also navigation would be easier.

That night our destination was Cassoday, KS, a town with a population of just 128. The road there was so peaceful.

We ended up camping for the first time since Illinois. We found a nice gazebo to pitch our tents and the next morning we were delighted with an awesome sunrise.

The next day we made our way to Newton, KS. We arranged a Warm Showers host for that night so we were excited to have the comfort of a home. The ride there was short but it was pretty nice.


Anyways, we checked out [a bike shop](http://www.newtonbikeshop.com/) in Newton that also operates as a hostel for touring cyclists. Shortly after arriving, we learned that there was another race that crosses the US called the [TransAm Bike Race](http://transambikerace.com/). I met some racers at the shop and enjoyed talking with them. The race is still young and has only been going on for a few years but I think it's gaining traction.

We stayed with a woman named Janet in Newton. She was really nice and friendly. Also, we met another cyclist who was staying there. His name is Colin and he has [a cool blog](http://www.memybikeandacamera.com/).

The next night we stayed at a church in Hutchinson, KS that is also a free hostel for cyclists. I love places like this.

Turns out the pastor is an avid cyclist. He used to have a bike shop in town and wants to help touring cyclists along their journey.

The next few days we stayed in some tiny isolated towns in Kansas. Most of the days we showered in the town pools and camped in the public parks. We found some Zebras on one of our rides. I'm not kidding.

After Dighton we rode to a town called Leoti, KS. We had a good amount a headwind that day and were happy to arrive to a Warm Showers host. It turns out that our host wasn't even home but she told us we are welcome to use her house. I'm always amazed by how generous and trusting some people are. We made ourselves some good food in her kitchen. 

The next day I went over to the library and found an awesome watercolor picture book along with some history and information about Kansas. The information in the book was fascinating and the paintings in were beautiful. The book showed me the love that people have for Kansas. Although some people may find the state boring there's definitely beauty in it's peacefulness and serenity.

The next day we made it to Colorado. Almost immediately we noticed the scenery starting to change from farms to shrubby things. I talked to someone about it later and they told me it's because of farming legislature.

And finally we got to the mountains.

I'm looking forward to climbing these things!
