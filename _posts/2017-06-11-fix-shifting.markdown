The other day I was riding up a hill and attempted to shift into an easier gear when it happened. **My shift cable snapped**. With no more tension on my rear derailleur my chain shifted down to the smallest cog on the cassette, making it much more difficult to get up the hill. My shift cable had detached from the shifter on my handlebars.

Upon further expection, I found that my cable shifter frayed down so much that it just couldn't hang on anymore and broke.

I've had this problem in the past and have also seen it happen to friends. It's a normal wear and tear sort of thing. Luckily I had all the tools and parts I needed to fix it, so I started to get to work.

## Required Tools/Parts
1. Shift Cable (~$5)
1. Shift Cable Housing (Skinny black tube thing that wire goes through) (~$5)
1. [Wire Cutters](https://www.amazon.com/Park-Tool-Professional-Housing-Cutter/dp/B0047VQEGM) (~$35)
1. Allen Wrench (~$10)
1. Housing Caps (<$1)
1. Cable Caps (<$1)



## Step #1: Remove Old Cable and Housing

You're going to want to strip the bad stuff off your bike. Use your allen wrench to loosen the screw on your rear derailleur. Then cut off the end of cable.

At this point you should be able to slide the cable out and remove all the housing.

## Step #2: Put in New Cable and Housing

Slide your cable wire into your shifter. You may need to remove the tension from your rear brake to make this task easier.

Pull the wire all the way through until you can't pull any further.

Next, you need to cut your new housing so that its length matches the old one.

Put on a housing caps to both ends of the housing.

Slide your housing onto the wire and place the end of it into the housing stop.

Thread the cable through the thing at the bottom of the frame.

Repeat the same process for the other piece of housing.

## Step #3: Configure tension

You're going to want to get the tension right so you can shift properly. Make sure that your shifter is set to the lowest tension and pull the cable as much as you can. You may want to use a rag so that the cable doesn't cut you.

Thread your cable under the cable anchor bolt and tighten screw. At the point your going to want to simulate pedalling and shifting.

Make sure shifting is happening smoothly and keep adjusting until you get it right.

## Step #4: Finish Up

Cut the end of the wire. You don't want it to be too long, but not too short either.

Find your cable cap. It should look like this.

Put on your cable cap and squash it with the flat part of the wire cutters.

There you have it. Your bike should be shifting smoothly and and you're ready to tackle those hills!
