The other day I was riding up a hill and attempted to shift into an easier gear when it happened. **My shift cable snapped**. With no more tension on my rear derailleur my chain shifted down to the smallest cog on the cassette, making it much more difficult to get up the hill. My shift cable had detached from the shifter on my handlebars.

Upon further expection, I found that my cable shifter frayed down so much that it just couldn't hang on anymore and broke.

I've had this problem in the past and have also seen it happen to friends. It's a normal wear and tear sort of thing. Luckily I had all the tools and parts I needed to fix it, so I started to get to work.

## Required Tools
1. Shift Cable
1. Shift Cable Housing
1. Wire Cutters
1. Allen Wrench

## Step 1: Remove Old Cable and Housing

You're going to want to strip the bad stuff off your bike. Use your allen wrench to loosen the screw on your rear derailleur. Then cut off the end of cable.

You should be able to slide the cable out and remove all the old wiring.
