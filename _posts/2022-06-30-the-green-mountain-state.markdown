A few weeks ago a good friend of mine and I were talking and he mentioned something that piqued my interest. A few hours drive away a 200 mile bike ride was talking place stretching from the Canadian border to the Massachusetts border all following along Vermont's route 100. As such the ride is called the 200-on-100. It sounded like a crazy adventure and definitely seemed like would be a challenge to say the least.

Three weeks later I found myself heading to the Green Mountain State to manifest my new vision: to complete the ride.

Although the original friend who suggested in wasn't able to make it, he connected me with his buddy, Lance, whom I'd met before briefly so that we'd be able to complete it together.

Logistically it was a bit of a puzzle to figure the planning for it since the ride has no formal registration, transportation, and there's really not much infrastructure at the start or finish of the race (including cell service).

Nevertheless Lance and I devized a plan to complete the journey. On the day before the race, we'd meet together in separate cars at the Mass border, I'd drop my car off, we'd drive together up to his place in central Vermont, and his girlfriend would drive us to an inn near the start of the ride the night before. Then the next morning of the ride at the crack of dawn we'd do a 6 mile bike ride to the canadian border, bike 200 miles south back to my car, then drive back to his place in central Vermont. Simple right?

Not quite, but we made it work. We talked to a local bartender at the finish in Readsboro VT and she kindly told us of a good spot we could park overnight. We then started the journey backwards by car along VT route 100. As we drove and chatted, we admired the beautiful landscape, but at the same time I was slightly overwhelmed by the length of it. It was a long drive let alone biking the whole thing!

After several hours in the car, we made it up to Lance's home in Moretown, VT his girlfriend graciously volunteered to drive us to the almost start of the race the night before in Jay, VT, just 6 miles from the canadian border. The hotel we stayed at was more of a ski lodge than anything else. Definitely gave the nice Vermont cozy lodge vibe. Seemed like a nice place to enjoy a warm drink by the fireplace, however it was summer time and warm so sort of a strange combination of vibes.

The next morning we took off to get to the start. It was just a 20 minute ride or so starting around 4:30am when we got to see the sunrise. We joked that the 200 miles was not enough so wanted to tack on a few warm up bonus miles.

There was a brief opening ceremoney and roughly 50 riders showed up to tackle the feat. There were some cycling teams with matching kit and most people seemed to have a support vehicle with them but most people were friendly and spirits were high.

Lance and I actually led the pack for the first few miles or so until some riders creeped up behind us and ended up slowly passing by. Of course to optimize our long journey we started a paceline. Some of the riders definitely seemed like they were probably overdoing it since it was only the start of a super long journey, however we ended up getting in a great groove and the first 70 or so miles flew by as we mostly drafted behind some strong rider.

Lance's girlfriend graciously met us at mile 70 with the best mushroom/cheddar grilled sandwhich I think I've ever had. Along with an almost croissant, I was absolutely ready for a meal to replenish what I'd lost in the first few hours.
