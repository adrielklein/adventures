A few weeks ago a good friend of mine and I were talking and he mentioned something that piqued my interest. A few hours drive away a 200 mile bike ride was talking place stretching from the Canadian border to the Massachusetts border all following along Vermont's route 100. As such the ride is called the 200-on-100. It sounded like a crazy adventure and definitely seemed like would be a challenge to say the least.

Three weeks later I found myself heading to the Green Mountain State to manifest my new vision: to complete the ride.

Although the original friend who suggested in wasn't able to make it, he connected me with his buddy, Lance, whom I'd met before briefly so that we'd be able to complete it together.

Logistically it was a bit of a puzzle to figure the planning for it since the ride has no formal registration, transportation, and there's really not much infrastructure at the start or finish of the race (including cell service).

Nevertheless Lance and I devized a plan to complete the journey. On the day before the race, we'd meet together in separate cars at the Mass border, I'd drop my car off, we'd drive together up to his place in central Vermont, and his girlfriend would drive us to an inn near the start of the ride the night before. Then the next morning of the ride at the crack of dawn we'd do a 6 mile bike ride to the canadian border, bike 200 miles south back to my car, then drive back to his place in central Vermont. Simple right?

Not quite, but we made it work. We talked to a local bartender at the finish in Readsboro VT and she kindly told us of a good spot we could park overnight. We then started the journey backwards by car along VT route 100. As we drove and chatted, we admired the beautiful landscape, but at the same time I was slightly overwhelmed by the length of it. It was a long drive let alone biking the whole thing!

After several hours in the car, we made it up to Lance's home in Moretown, VT his girlfriend graciously volunteered to drive us to the almost start of the race the night before in Jay, VT, just 6 miles from the canadian border. The hotel we stayed at was more of a ski lodge than anything else. Definitely gave the nice Vermont cozy lodge vibe. Seemed like a nice place to enjoy a warm drink by the fireplace, however it was summer time and warm so sort of a strange combination of vibes.

The next morning we took off to get to the start. It was just a 20 minute ride or so starting around 4:30am when we got to see the sunrise. We joked that the 200 miles was not enough so wanted to tack on a few warm up bonus miles.

There was a brief opening ceremoney and roughly 50 riders showed up to tackle the feat. There were some cycling teams with matching kit and most people seemed to have a support vehicle with them but most people were friendly and spirits were high.

Lance and I actually led the pack for the first few miles or so until some riders creeped up behind us and ended up slowly passing by. Of course to optimize our long journey we started a paceline. Some of the riders definitely seemed like they were probably overdoing it since it was only the start of a super long journey, however we ended up getting in a great groove and the first 70 or so miles flew by as we mostly drafted behind some strong rider.

Lance's girlfriend graciously met us at mile 70 with the best mushroom/cheddar grilled sandwhich I think I've ever had. Along with an almost croissant, I was absolutely ready for a meal to replenish what I'd lost in the first few hours.

That's us at our rest stop at mile 70. After getting the rejuvination we continued onward with the two of us. Lance and I were trading off pulls, until we started getting to some climbs where I let Lance pull me as he is the better climber and overall better endurance athlete than I. Eventually Lance was doing the majority of the pulling even on flats as he seemed to be in better shape.

Our first major climb of the day was as we approached Killington where Lance definitely pulled away and I fought on my own taking on the roughly 10-15% grades. At this point we were just over the halfway mark and temperatures approached 90 degrees with full sunshine.

The climb was vigourous and I was definitely pleased as we reach our second rest stop at about 110/120mi into the trip atop our climb where we refueled at a gas station. We both chugged down a couple cold carton of coconut water and started hitting the energy sources with some bars and cookies.

The descent down Killington mountain was not as pleasant as I would have hoped. Although we were descending it was still very hot and the wind was very strong on the way down where you had to grasp the handlebars carefully to avoid losing control.

We continued onward and as we did so my calves and quads I believe began to cramp on the climbs. My body was clearly telling itself it was being overworked. Lance tried helping me out supply some salt pills to help ease the cramping. I believe perhaps the pills helped but did still experience a bit of cramping. The one solution I found was just to ease off the gas a bit. So on flats I was definitely able to still hang with Lance by sucking his wheel but on climbs I let him surpass me in order for me to avoid burning out. I felt a bit unappreciative of my friends effort  by not doing my share of pulling the load, however we both needed to get to the finish especially since my car was there and I would be driving us both back to his house. So I sort of took a backseat roll for some of the workload, did what I could, but certainly eased up on pushing it through the climbs and took a more comfortable pace for myself especially as the gradients became challenging.

We approach our third rest stop of the day in Ludlow, VT at about mile 130/140 where Lance and I went straight into to the refridgerator to cool off and chugged down a gatorade or two.

After eating some snack and meandering through the store I came across a map of Vermont with our location pinned via a thumbtack.

It was super encouraging to see that distance-wise were were almost there. As for distance we only had about 30-40% of the ride left and it was only about 1 or 2 pm. So we felt like we were in good shape! In the back of my mind I knew that these final miles would be the most treacherous but I kind of shielded my concious from the cold hard truth.

Anyways we began chugging along again and hit our second major climb of the day. This one was more treacherous than Killington. In fact the mountain itself is called Mount Terrible. Lance did it quicker but believe the climb must have took me 30-60 minutes and seemed like it would never end with some grueling gradients at nearly 13%.

At the top I was pleased to be greated not just by lance but a support vehicle for one of the other two riders who were tag-teaming the double century and trading off riding/driving the route. They were kind enough to refill our waters which was super helpful.

The descent down Mount Terrible wasn't bad and it actually led us into some very pleasant riding near Mt snow. We finally had some mostly flat sections and the three of us (Lance, the tag teaming rider, and I) made some good swift progress together mostly thanks to Lance being an animal and pulling us through with seamingless endless endurance.

At about 1K ft we made our way to a country store in Jamaica, VT. I believe if it weren't for me Lance and the other dude would have kept pushing on, but I insisted that I needed to fill up water and in all honestly just wanted another break as well.

Kindly enough both stopped to accomodate my request at the store where we came across a group of three other riders. They were in their 30s + 40s and all looked like very strong cyclists. In fact we had seen them in the opening miles of the race and I think some of them were pulling briefly, although I don't think we had crossed paths since over 100 miles back.

Fighting through the same endeavor, we had something in common so I figured I'd be friendly and asked one of the guys how he was doing. "How are you doing?", I asked him.

"I'm a bit saddle sore but other than that not too bad", he said.

Then to my surprise he said, "It's definitely harder going southbound rather than northbound."

At this point I'm confused. The ride going from Canada to Massachusetts, where is the northbound in that? The entire thing is southbound. So I asked, "What do you mean by northbound? This ride is only southbound".

"Yesterday we parked at the Massachusetts border and rode up to the start of the ride where we spend the night and today we're going back down. It's definitely harder going southbound since you have to do all the climbing in the end".

My mind was blown. Here I was partaking in probably the hardest physical feat of my life. Something that most people would say is absolutely ridiculous. And here are some guys that are older than us, doing back to back double centuries. They were doing this absolutely massive ride twice, with only a nights rest in between.

Anyways the guys were very nice and encouraging. After chatting with one of the dudes, Ralph, he had mentioned than all three of them were "washed up" competitive cyclists. I don't believe any of them were pro but I have a feeling that they were just a step below that. He'd mentioned that some of the other guys were often winners in their bike racing scene.

Together the five us descended quickly to the bottom of the next upcoming monster climb. I started pacelining with the three guys and as we passed Lance and the other dude, I told them to hop on to optimize the draft.

Lance was super appreciative especially since he'd been pulling for so long previously and now could get some "active rest" time.
