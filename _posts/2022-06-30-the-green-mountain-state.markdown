A few weeks ago a good friend of mine and I were talking and he mentioned something that piqued my interest. A few hours drive away a 200 mile bike ride was talking place stretching from the Canadian border to the Massachusetts border all following along Vermont's route 100. As such the ride is called the 200-on-100. It sounded like a crazy adventure and definitely seemed like would be a challenge to say the least.

Three weeks later I found myself heading to the Green Mountain State to manifest my new vision: to complete the ride.

Although the original friend who suggested in wasn't able to make it, he connected me with his buddy, Lance, whom I'd met before briefly so that we'd be able to complete it together.

Logistically it was a bit of a puzzle to figure the planning for it since the ride has no formal registration, transportation, and there's really not much infrastructure at the start or finish of the race (including cell service).

Nevertheless Lance and I devized a plan to complete the journey. On the day before the race, we'd meet together in separate cars at the Mass border, I'd drop my car off, we'd drive together up to his place in central Vermont, and his girlfriend would drive us to an inn near the start of the ride the night before. Then the next morning of the ride at the crack of dawn we'd do a 6 mile bike ride to the canadian border, bike 200 miles south back to my car, then drive back to his place in central Vermont. Simple right?
