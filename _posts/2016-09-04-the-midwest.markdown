In order to ensure I had a place to stay each night, I had planned my route for the next 650 miles from Sandusky, OH to St. Louis, MO. The route would take me 11 days (~60mi/day), 9 of which I had a Warm Showers host and the other 2 would be at campgrounds. Although I did a great job with logistic planning, I failed to schedule a rest day in there and I would later regret this.

The one thing I like about riding in the Eastern part of the united states is the sheer number of roads. Among all the selection and with tools like Google Maps, I was able to plan out some pretty sweet rides on roads that nobody seemed to know about.

On my way to Marion, OH on one of the rural backgrounds, I ended up finding a house with a medieval knight in full armor standing outside the front door. Sometimes you see the craziest things in the middle of nowhere.

Although I enjoy maps and navigation, I usually prefer not to worry about them during a ride. By creating custom routes on Google Maps the night before my ride and loading them up on my Garmin, I was able to ride through the peaceful farmland without worrying about directions. Some of these roads couldn't be more pleasant, and it was great to be guided by a computer the whole way.

As I entered the city of West Liberty, OH I found a sign with my name on it. It turns out Adriel is also the name of a social services agency that provides foster care for children. Since I almost never see my name anywhere, I had to go in to the place and talk to someone there. As I entered the building, an administrative woman approached and introduced herself. I replied back, "Hi, I'm Adriel." The woman's eyes lit up and I could tell she wasn't quite expecting that curveball. Anyways, the people there were very nice and even talked to me a bit about the work they do.

One of my favorite discoveries of Ohio was the bike paths. To my delight, I learned that Ohio has the largest network of paved bike paths in the country.

Although I only got to ride on a small portion of all the paved bike paths Ohio had to offer, I really enjoyed them. Also, I hope to do some more touring in Ohio to get to more of the paths.

# Indiana

Of my entire trip, Indiana was the state I spent the least amount of time in. I only spent three nights in the Hoosier State, one of which was my first night at a campground.

It was in Indiana when the first signs of fatigue begun. When it started hitting me, I was a bit surprised. I knew I was in good shape but for some reason my muscles were getting achy and the riding started feeling like a chore instead of a pleasure. Although a rest day would have been nice, I already had my hosts all planned. If I took a rest day, I would have to reschedule with all my hosts and I figured the least I could do was be accurate with these generous people about my date of arrival.

The fatigue definitely started getting bad as I hit Bloomington because of its relentless hills.

Bloomington would have been a nice place to take a rest day because it seemed like a nice town, however my schedule dictated I push onward. I was so sore, that I resorted to getting a ride for part of my ride the next day to get over some of the hills. I was normally opposed to hitch-hiking because I was afraid of abduction or something, but I was desperate at this point so I flagged down a car for help. As it turns out, the man who pulls over happened to be an Uber driver. He told me I should request a ride from him with my phone so he could work while bringing me along my journey. For whatever reason the app wasn't working on my phone so I suggested we just cut the middle man out. I offered him a $20 for the ride, he accepted, and we were on our way.

The next town I rode to was Farmersburg, where I got the pleasure of staying with the kindest hosts. It was also at this host where I was fed some of the most delicious food of the trip. I believe it was homemade fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and roasted green beans. What a meal!

# Illinois

As I entered the Land of Lincoln, my fatigue was starting to take over. I remember every morning I woke up my body would ache and I would wish to just go back to bed. My main goal was to make it to St. Louis, where I would spend a rest day before my next leg. I had found a Warm Showers host in St. Louis, so I just needed to get there.
