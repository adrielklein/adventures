Does anybody else use state nicknames except for me? I think for most of us we had some point in elementary school where we had to memorize these names and then thereafter the only other time we've seen them is when we see a state sign on the road when traversing through states.

Anyways I get why Florida is the sunshine state, there is a lot of sunshine there but surprisingly the city of Miami gets just as much rain as Portland, Oregon. The main difference is that when it rains it pours in Miami and in Portland it just drizzles barely enough to make you miserable for 8 months out of the year.

Luckily in Florida I spent most of my time there during the winter months when generally there are fewer storms since it's less likely to be ridiculously hot and humid to the point where the sky can't handle it anymore and dumps it all out.

Therefore I enjoyed much of my riding in Florida. This is a special state for me since I spent months at a time here over multiple years, escaping from the Northeast winters since fortunately my day job allows me to work remotely.

They way I split up my touring in Florida was over the course of two winters. The first winter I went from Miami to Key West, and second winter up from Palm beach to Jacksonville to do the whole coast. Don't worry I was able to tackle Miami to Palm beach via a series of day trips during my first winter to make it complete.

Actually my idea of going to Florida in the first place revolved around the fantasy of biking all the way to Key West, surrounding myself with Dolphins and turquoise waters to get to the southermost point of the country.

And the above is what I did, in December of 2020 I flew down to Miami, assembled my bike, and the next day got on the bike and headed down South.

Right off the bat, I was heading down some beautiful roads. Shortly after getting through downtown and brickel I was brought to the beautiful surburb of Coconut grove where some of the roads absolutely stunned me with their beauty
